# TC-Hydro
TC-Hydro Model 

With the purpose of enhancing the analysis and design of bioretention systems, the TC-Hydro model has been developed.

TC-Hydro is a tool developed in VBA language and can be applicable for the following bioretention system analysis:

- Design and Simulation of Bioretention Systems
- One-at-time Sensitivity Analysis
- Monte Carlo Simulations
- Design Optimization using Evolucionary Algorithm approach
- Critical rainfall duration assessment
- Box-plot hydrograph assessment

The software requires a license of Microsoft Excel 2013 or superior. The user has to enable editing and macros, as well as enabling the solver and developer add-ons for better performance.

Please, refer to the Supplementary Material for detailed information of the interfaces and equations used in the software.
